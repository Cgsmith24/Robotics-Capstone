2: Project TASRC has used 150g of filament to date, 5 servos, some aliuminum, 4 shocks, and roughly 40$ in the budget.
3: I need to get some better wheels, I don't need to print anything else as of right now. The only system that has yet to be designed is the steering, 
But I already have an idea about how to do that. 
I will demonstrate the steering colum and the 4 shocks moving on left/right controls.
